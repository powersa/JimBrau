## A Reinterpretation of Middlebrow's Early Years
## with Jim Limperis



**On a cold February week in 2011, Middlebrow was faced with a dilemma. Though the group was on tour, they had encountered a *once in a generation* comedic talent in a small New England town.**



**True, his improvisation skills were raw, but his work with props and thousand watt smile made up for that a thousand-million times over.**



## But... There was the whole thing of Middlebrow being for Middlebury students.



## And... There was his familial relationship with a current member.



## **AGAINST OUR BETTER JUDGMENT**
**we decided not to take him on as a full Middlebrow member. We made a mistake that day. Let's imagine how Middlebrow might have looked if we'd gotten it right...**

Look, we get it, you guys have comedic chemistry. How about doing a scene with someone else?

Jim's a little skeptical of the prop work here. Hopefully its just a long cup.
